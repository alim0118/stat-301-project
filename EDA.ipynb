    "This question focuses on predicting the number of stars (popularity) of a GitHub repository, which corresponds to the response variable `Stars`. The explanatory variables include the number of times the repository has been forked by other users, `Forks`, the number of users monitoring the repository for activity updates or changes, `Watchers`, and a binary indicator denoting whether the repository uses the GitHub Projects tool for task management, `Has Projects`. Through this analysis, we can explore whether popularity varies based on whether the repository uses GitHub projects.   "
